<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# ðŸ“– [Hello_Microverse] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Hello_Microverse]** is a basic project. In this project, I have set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is implemented here. My goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about github. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!
